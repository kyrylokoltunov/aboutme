# Hi there!

I'm Kyrylo, a Data Science and Statistics major at St. Olaf. 

My work philosophy is creating meaningful impact by letting facts and numbers guide decisions.

I leverage R, Python, and SQL to manage and analyze complex datasets, generating actionable insights and tailored solutions for various business domains.
