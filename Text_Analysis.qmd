# The Ole Store Restaurant – Google Reviews Analysis  
_By Kyrylo Koltunov_

---

My mini project examines Google reviews for one of my favorite places to dine in Northfield, MN — **The Ole Store Restaurant**. Known for its Norwegian and European cuisine, this place holds a special place in the community. With over 800 Google reviews, it offers a rich dataset for meaningful text analysis.

The goal of this project is to explore the **psychology of customer feedback**, understand trends in positive and negative reviews, and highlight linguistic patterns in user-generated comments.

Scatterplot Analysis
---

**📌 Insert scatterplot image here**

The first scatterplot shows that the longest reviews were mostly written for **5-star ratings**, while reviews with 4, 3, 2, or 1 stars tended to be shorter or even empty. Many 1-star reviews consisted of only a few words or no text at all.

Positive reviews tend to be longer because people are more inclined to describe enjoyable experiences. Negative reviewers often use minimal effort—unless a situation was extremely upsetting, in which case the text becomes much longer (e.g., a 600-character 1-star outlier).

Contain fewer adjectives and more neutral nouns. Themes mention slow service, overcooked dishes, and mixed experiences.

### **1-Star Reviews**
Focus on dissatisfaction: *waitress, disappointing, cold, staff, hair, breakfast*.  
Words like *girlfriend* and *left* reflect emotionally charged experiences.
